## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_
1. _p -> q_ Assume
2. _q_ MP
3. _p -> r_ Assume
4. _r_ MP
5. _(q AND r)_ Conjunction








### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_
1. _p -> (q OR r)_ Assume
2. _p -> (q OR NOT r)_ Assume
3. _p -> (q OR r) AND (q OR NOT r)_ Proof 1
4. _p -> (q OR (r AND NOT r))_ Distributive
5. _r AND NOT r -> F_ Negation
6. _q OR F -> q_ Identity
7. _p -> q_ MP







## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

1. s -> t = (NOT(s) OR t)
2. p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (NOT(s) OR t)))

4. NOT(NOT(s) OR t) = s AND NOT(t)
5. NOT (r) OR (s AND NOT(t))
6. p OR (q AND (NOT (r) OR (s AND NOT(t)))) = (p OR q) AND (p OR (NOT (r) OR (s AND NOT(t))))

Satisfiable                                   

I used exhaustive at first, but the short certificate version is looking at whether p is true or false and determining satisfiability from there.
