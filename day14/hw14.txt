I. Math

In the following problems, we will look at how rapidly different functions grow.  We are interested in figuring out when two functions grow at the same rate.  Our definition of “the same” is:  f(n) grows no faster than g(n) if there is some minimum value for the argument (we’ll call it n0) after which f(n) is no larger than a constant multiple of g(n) -- call it k*g(n).  For example, if f(n) is 367n+1098 and g(n) is 2n, n0 could be 40 and k could be 200:  367n+1098 <= 200*2n for n>40.

For each of the following pairs of functions, identify a multiplier and a minimum value of n for which the first is no larger than the specified multiple of the second.  If you cannot -- if there are no such values -- explain why not.


  A. 367n+1098     and     2n                  [n0 = 40; k=200]
  B. n^2 + 2n + 6    and     6n^2 - 25         [n0 = 3; k=1]
  C. n^3 + n^2 - 2n     and     6n^2 - 25      This can't work because f(n) scales faster than g(n) can, no constant can mitigate that growth.
  D. 869,438    and    923                      [n0=0; k=942]
  E. 2^n    and    3^n                          [n0=1; k=1]
  F. 3^n    and    2^n                          f(n) scales faster than g(n) at a non-constant rate, so no constant multiplier can make g(n) keep up.
  G. log_2 n     and    log_10 n    [NB:  these are intended to be log-base-2 of n and log-base-10 of n] [n0 = 1; k=4]
  H. log_10 n^2    and     log_2 n              f(n) is always less than g(n), so: [n0=1;k=1]


II. Linear data structures

For the following problem, assume that it costs 1 unit to access a structure -- an item in an array, a field in a record you are holding, the first element in a linked list -- whether reading or writing that element.  [Accessing the second element in a linked list costs 2 units if you have a pointer to the list:  1 unit to access the first element/read its “next” pointer, and another unit to access the second element.]

Assume that you have n elements stored in an array and the same n elements stored in a linked list; you have no other references to these data structures.  You may assume that n > 10.  How much does it cost to perform each of the following actions?

  A. Read the value of the first element in the array?  In the list?   1; 1
  B. Read the value of the seventh element in the array?  In the list? 1; 7
  C. Add an element to the array?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]  To the list?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]  Assuming this is a static array, it is of fixed size and therefore incapable of having an element added to it. You could make a new array of the appropriate size and copy over the original content in addition to the added element, which would be roughly n+1 units. The list should add the new element at the front, because that is the cheapest part of the list to reach, and from there the new element can be added with a pointer to the original first element. 1; 1
  D. Delete the fifth element from the array?  From the list?  The static array can't delete elements any more than it can add them, but you could make a new array of a smaller size and copy over all the elements except the fifth one.  n-1; 5 (assuming that the list takes 4 units to get to element 4 and 1 unit to rewrite the "next" pointer to the 6th element.
  E. Confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?  element;element  (the structures would start at the beginning and check each element until it found the right one. In the worst case, this could be an n unit operation, but in the best case it could only take one unit. This being if the desired element is last in the list or first respectively.
  F. Confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is NOT present in the array?  In the list? element;element  (again, if the structure contains the element, the statement will be proved false before going through the entire list and stop at the desired element, but if we assume the element is not in the structure, it becomes an n unit operation.

Now assume that you can maintain one extra piece of storage for the data structure.  In the case of the array, you may want to maintain a length reference.
In the case of the linked list, what would be similarly helpful? The storage remembering which element is last in the list.
G. How much would it cost now to add an element to the end of the array?  To add an element to the end of the list?  In the case of the array, if we assume the extra piece of storage is used to be sure there are n free units on the end, adding an element to the end would take only 1 unit. If, in the case of the list, we use the extra storage to hold the final element in the list, the operation costs only 1 unit.
H. How much would it cost now to delete an element from the array?  From the list?  What if it were the final element?  The penultimate element?  Array: if it's from the beginning, n units. List: if it's from the beginning, 1 unit. Array: if it's the final element, 1 unit. List: if it's from the end, 1 unit. Array: if it's the penultimate element, the operation would take 2 units, one to delete the element and one to shift the ending element into the newly vacated spot. List: if it's the penultimate element the operation will also take 2 units, assuming the links in the list work both ways.

Finally, assume that both the array and the linked list are sorted, i.e., that their elements are in some predictable order (say, comparable by < or <=).
  J. How much would it cost to confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?  To confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is not present in the array?  In the list? The major difference that comes about from ordering the structures is that sorting algorithms can be used on them. Array: the operation would take about log(n) units, because you could start at the middle and, based on the value of that element, move up or down depending on the value you're looking for. Effectively, the algorithm starts in the middle, moves to the middle of the correct half, and repeats untill it finds the value or the value can't exist in the array. List: the operation would take about (1/2)n units, because you have to follow the list from one end or the other, and judging by the values of the first element and the last element, you can guess which side is more likely to have the element you're looking for. This assumes regular intervals between values of the ordered elements. Determining if something is not in both the array and list would have, respectively, the same unit consumption as seeing if something is in them, worst case scenario.
